# Student CRUD RESTFul APIs

## Overview
This is a simple RESTful API for managing student records. It allows users to perform CRUD operations on student data using Java, Jakarta EE, and Jersey (JAX-RS). The API is designed to be deployed on a Jakarta EE-compliant server such as Apache Tomcat.

## Features
- Register a new student
- Retrieve all students or a student by ID
- Update student details
- Delete a student record
- Uses in-memory storage (HashMap) for simplicity
- JSON-based request and response

## Technologies Used
- Java (Jakarta EE)
- Jersey (JAX-RS) for RESTful API
- Apache Tomcat as the application server
- JSON for data exchange

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Student_CRUD_RestFul_APIs.git
   cd Student_CRUD_RestFul_APIs
   ```
2. Build the project using Maven:
   ```sh
   mvn clean package
   ```
3. Deploy the generated `.war` file to your Tomcat server:
   ```sh
   cp target/StudentForm.war $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/
   ```
4. Start your Tomcat server and access the API at:
   ```sh
   http://localhost:8080/StudentForm
   ```
